# Overview

A set of tools for working with the Kobe Collection: ship logbook data from 1889 to 1961 included in the [International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set](https://icoads.noaa.gov/) (ICOADS). These tools are designed around the analysis of historical patterns of Japanese commercial shipping.

With minor modifications, the tools can also be applied to other collections in ICOADS.
