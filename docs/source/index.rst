Welcome
============================================================

Kobe Collection (KC) Tools is a collection of tools for working with the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS). The tools were designed primarily for work with one subset of the ICOADS: the Kobe Collection, hence the name. The Kobe Collection consists of observations from Japanese ship log sheets from 1889 to 1961 digitized by the Japan Meteorological Agency.
