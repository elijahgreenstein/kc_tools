Welcome
============================================================

KC Tools is a collection of tools for working with the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS). The tools were designed primarily for research on one subset of the ICOADS: the Kobe Collection. The Kobe Collection consists of observations from Japanese ship log sheets from 1889 to 1961 digitized by the Japan Meteorological Agency.

The tools in this package facilitate the analysis of historical ship movements. The processing tools extract time and location data and generate lines from point data. The package also provides tools to determine the direction of shipping traffic and to facilitate the generation of networks (graphs).

Read the tutorials below to learn how to

* clean the data,
* quantify traffic across particular maritime spaces,
* calculate voyage times,
* identify possible ports of call, and
* generate port networks.
